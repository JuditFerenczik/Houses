# Houses

Its a working management system for houses on which they are currently working to build. You can add different types of houses to the database by entering its data in the GUI(address, size, start of the work, end of the work,
number of people living there, roof, garage, elevator, number of flats). 
On the right side in the listbox you can see the already entered houses. By clicking on them you can modify their details or even delete them.
